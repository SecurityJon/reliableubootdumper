# Intro
Reliable Uboot Flash Dumper is a Python tool for dumping flash via uboot reliably. If you've ever had to dump flash via uboot and a serial connection and became frustrated about doing it several times and hand-merging files together to fix issues, this should help you out

# Requirements
sudo pip3 install requirements.txt

# Usage
sudo python3 reliableubootflashdumper.py [location of file to dump to] [flash size to dump in MB] [Serial Port to Use] [Baud Rate to Use]

# Warning
This is mostly untested (although it works for me) but the code should be easy enough to understand
